<h1>Camel Routes</h1>

<h3>This sample project has the objective of show the integration between the technologies</h3>:
	- apache-camel
	- spring 
	- jooq
Also created simple routes, as:
	- Direct
	- Timer
	- File
	- Rest
I wait with this project, remove doubts about integrations, patterns and implementations of routes.

You can build the WAR by running:
	mvn clean install
	
You can then run the project by dropping the WAR into your 
favorite web container or just run:
	mvn jetty:run
to start up and deploy to Jetty.

But, for run in tomcat with eclipse, execute the commands
	mvn clean install eclipse:eclipse -Dwtpversion=2.0

Thanks, and any doubts, please, call me.
